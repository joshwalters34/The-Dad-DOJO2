## Overview

The Dad DOJO is a website made by Dad's for Dad's (or anyone who enjoys lame jokes, mixology, and barbeque). We created our site to help Dad's up their "Dad Game" by providing them a one stop shop with very necessary, but very stereotypical information related to being a Dad. 

## Purpose and Description of Work

-- Using HTML, CSS, Javascript and several other third party APIs we created a website that allows users to search new BBQ recipes, "Dad" jokes, and cocktail recipes. 

-- Each modal lets the user cycle through a variety BBQ recipes, cocktail recipes, and jokes. 

-- If a user likes a joke or recipe our site allows them to save it to their "favorites" section and it is stored in local storage for the next time they visit the site. 

-- It is our hope that our site provides some satire and humor to the people who visit, but also provides real information and smooth functionality.
